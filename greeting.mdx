# Hi, there!

Hello, visitor!

First of all, I'm really thank you for visit my blog page ~ ðŸŽ‰

Since this new start, I have run [Tistory blog](https://july249.tistory.com/). But it has some limited condition for styling and something was weird.

So, I decide that I have to make a new space to publish my article. And I had searched the right place to make my posting more properly and readable.

However, I couldn't find the one to publish my article. So, I just made one.

Of course, this blog was not made by my own original idea! I made this mdx remote blog followed by [Dave Gray's NextJS Tutorial Lecture](https://youtu.be/6ih_3m_UPKg).

I would like to take this opportunity to express my infinite gratitude to Dave.

Anyway, I launch this blog to refresh!

So, I will upload TIL, Trouble-Shooting Log, and something more useful things for sharing idea!

Then, see you soon with some new things!

Bye ~ ðŸ‘‹
