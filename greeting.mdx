# Hello, visitor!

First of all, I'm really thank you for visit my blog page ~ ðŸŽ‰

Before this new start, I had run Tistory blog. But it has some limited condition for styling and something was weird, especially hard to read what I posted.

So, I decided that I have to make a new space to publish my article. And I had looking for the right place to make my posting more properly and readable.

However, I couldn't find the place to publish my article. So, I just made one.

Of course, this blog was not made by my own original idea! I made this mdx remote blog by followed Dave Gray's NextJS Tutorial Lecture.

I would like to take this opportunity to express my infinite gratitude to Dave.

Anyway, I launch this blog to fresh start!

I will upload TIL, Trouble-Shooting Log, and something more useful things for sharing idea!

Then, see you soon with some new things!

Bye ~ ðŸ‘‹
